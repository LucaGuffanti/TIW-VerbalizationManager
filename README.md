# Verbalization Manager - Web Technologies Project
## Introduction
The requirement was to build a **web application** resembling the system used to verbalize results of an exam. A **teacher** would log in and insert, update, publish and verbalize grades for an exam. A **student** would log in and, after choosing an exam, see the result of the exam and eventually reject the assigned grade. 

The web application had to be build in two different ways:
 - Using a **Pure Html** approach, based on continuous GET/POST requests sent to the server.
 - Using a more modern **Rich Internet Application** approach, based on asynchronous invocations of the server (using AJAX)  and on client-side scripting using native javascript.
## What You'll find in this repository
In this repository you'll find
 - Complete implementation of the Pure HTML and RIA iterations of the assignment
 - A report for both the Pure HTML and RIA implementations
 - A Data Base dump (SQL)
## Ready, Set, Go!
To try out the project yourself, follow these simple steps
1. Download the code/clone this repository
2. Open your favourite Java IDE and import the projects using Maven. Make sure you have installed a HTTP server (Tomcat is recommended for this project as it was the used one)
3. Import the database dump into MySQL and set the **web.xml** file with your own credentials
4. Enjoy!
